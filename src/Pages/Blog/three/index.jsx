            With over 6.5 billion smartphone users worldwide, the expectations
            for mobile apps have never been higher. Users now demand
            lightning-fast performance, intuitive design, and a seamless
            experience across devices.
          </p>

          <p>
            At <strong className="text-orange-400">Lazy Do</strong>, we believe a great app isn't
            just built—it's carefully crafted with the user at the center. Here's
            a deep dive into our UX design process that has helped us deliver
            consistently engaging mobile experiences across industries.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🔍 Step 1: Discovery & User Research
          </h2>
          <p>
            We begin with understanding your audience, pain points, and
            expectations. Through stakeholder interviews, competitor audits, and
            user behavior analysis, we identify key goals for the app experience.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🧭 Step 2: Wireframes & User Journeys
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before diving into visuals, we sketch out information architecture,
            user flows, and interaction logic. This helps in creating a clear and
            conversion-focused user journey.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🎨 Step 3: Visual Design & Prototyping
          </h2>
          <p>
            Using tools like Figma and Adobe XD, we craft modern, brand-aligned
            UI with motion hints and responsive layout considerations. Our
            clickable prototypes give stakeholders and users a feel of the app
            before development.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🧪 Step 4: Usability Testing
          </h2>
          <p>
            We conduct real-user tests and get feedback on flow, readability, and
            ease of use. Insights from testing drive design refinements and help
            us eliminate friction points before coding starts.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🛠️ Step 5: Handoff to Development
          </h2>
          <p>
            We document everything in a developer-friendly way, using consistent
            tokens, spacing systems, and accessibility notes. This ensures
            pixel-perfect translation of design to code.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 text-white">
            🚀 The Result? Delightful Digital Experiences
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our UX-first approach ensures apps are not only beautiful, but also
            fast, accessible, and aligned with user needs. Whether it's a fitness
            tracker, finance app, or logistics dashboard—we prioritize
            experience, not just functionality.
